				<p>
					Popcorn Maker makes it easy to enhance, remix and share web videos by combining audio and video with live web content. But despite its potential power and ease of use, there has been limited adoption by professional journalists for a couple of reasons: 1) As an open source tool, Popcorn Maker was designed to be accessible to novices exploring content creation on the web. The current styles associated with Popcorn Maker are cartoonish and unsuitable for many news stories. And 2) because it’s an open source project, new versions (and new bugs) are regularly released. This makes for an unpredictable (and at times unstable) user experience. These aspects make it difficult to incorporate Popcorn Maker into the journalist’s toolset. 
				</p>

				<p>
					This summer we’re going to transform Popcorn Maker into Kettlecorn, a tool tailored for BBG journalists broadcasting around the world. We’re going to “create a storytelling platform that is built around the ODDI + BBG mission and hi-lite what makes international / multi-language storytelling unique and compelling.” We’re going to rethink, enhance, modify and restyle Popcorn Maker for the needs of international broadcasters. 
				<p>
					We’ll start by creating an official BBG instance of Popcorn Maker. We’ll focus on hosting a stabile instance with reliable core features and the ability to version and remix projects. We'll simplify the process of plugging Pangea audio or video into Popcorn Maker. And we’ll create improved workflows for journalists and leverage Popcorn templates to decrease the time-to-publish for new project.
				</p>

				<p>
					We’re going to restyle Popcorn for journalism. We’ll update the Popcorn event styles to make them more appropriate for journalism. We’ll redesign the Popcorn player for an improved user experience. And we’ll facilitate the branding and automatic rebranding of remixed popcorn projects. When RFA produces a project, a VOA language service can repackage the project and automatically rebrand the project for VOA. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We want to build a tool that facilitates the translation, sharing and broadcasting of stories between different language services. Our goal is to create a storytelling platform built around the BBG mission to support journalism broadcast in over sixty languages. To accomplish this goal we’ll start by expanding the range of languages that Popcorn Maker supports. We’ll make it easier for the content creator to switch between languages, between Spanish (left-to-right) and Arabic (right-to-left). Our second challenge is to integrate a machine translation service (e.g. Bing or Google) to automatically translate the text of a Popcorn project and allow someone to easily edit and refine the text as needed. This will hopefully enable and encourage language services to adopt and rebroadcast material across the agency and around the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					And finally we’ll create a showcase for Popcorn projects to allow services (and consumers) to search and sort projects to see what is available for translating and rebroadcasting.

				</p>
				<p>
					Kettlecorn is our chance to contribute to the open source movement and help establish our presence in the online journalism community. As a capstone to our project, we’d like to reach out to the Online News Association in order to host an ONA meetup, demo the project and showcase some of the other ODDI projects. We’d also like to open Kettlecorn up to local online journalists and partner to create sample seed projects and translations.
